            <p><strong>Welcome to our world</strong>
                By accessing or using this site, you agree 
                to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. 
                Please read them carefully or do not. We 
                will assume you did either way.</p>
            <h2><strong>1. Use at Your Own Risk</strong></h2>
                <p>While we do our best to make this site functional, 
                beautiful, and maybe even useful, we make no promises.
                Use of this website is entirely at your own risk, which
                includes, but is by no means limited to the risk of: 
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unexpected emotional distress as a result of our content.</li>
                        <li>Mild disappointment.</li>
                        <li>Or your device deciding it no longer wants to cooperate.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>If anything goes wrong, we sympathize deeply… but that is about it.</p>
            <h2><strong>2. Warranties, Guarantees and Regrets</strong></h2>
                <p>We do not gurantee that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site will always work.</li>
                        <li>The information is accurate, relevant, 
                            or even spelled correctly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Visiting may lead to an existential crisis 
                            or a strong urge to snack.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Everything here is provided “as is,” “as available,” 
                    and occasionally “as confusing.”</p>
            <h2><strong>3. Limitation of Liability</strong></h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
                <strong>we are not responsible for any loss, damage,
                heartbreak, or mild inconvenience</strong> resulting 
                from your use of this website.
                </p>
                <p>That includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Financial losses.</li>
                        <li>Data corruption.</li>
                        <li>Or your sudden realization that 
                            you have spent two hours scrolling our FAQ.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Basically: if it breaks, crashes, or explodes, that 
                is on you.</p>
            <h2><strong>4. User Conduct</strong></h2>
                <p>We kindly ask that you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do not hack us.</li>
                        <li>Do not spam us.</li>
                        <li>Do not use our site to summon ancient digital spirits.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Other than that, feel free to explore responsibly.</p>
            <h2><strong>5. Privacy</strong></h2>
                <p>We may collect basic information like cookies, IP addresses, 
                and how long you hovered over a button before finally clicking it.</p>
                <p>We promise not to sell your data, unless someone offers an absurd amount of money,
                in which case we will think about it (but probably still will not).</p>
                <p>We value your privacy almost as much as we value not getting sued.</p>
            <h2><strong>6. Changes to These Terms</strong></h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or completely rewrite these Terms whenever we feel like it.</p>
                <p>If that happens, the new version will replace this one, possibly without warning. Please check back 
                occasionally, or just live dangerously.</p>
            <h2><strong>7. Governing Law</strong></h2>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of whichever jurisdiction has the best coffee.</p>
            <h2><strong>8. Acceptance of Terms</strong></h2>
                <p>By using this site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms
                even if you definitely did not.</p>
            <h3><strong>In summary</strong></h3>
                <p>We will do our best to make this a good experience, but if anything goes wrong. You did not hear it from us.</p>
